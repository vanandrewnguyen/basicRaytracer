# basicRaytracer
I'm writing a ray-tracer!

Breakdown 
-
I wanted to learn C++ and Object-oriented programming, so I'm following a guide to write a small ray-tracer using SDL2 and native C++ libraries. 
I plan to eventually branch out and build on my own features such as new shapes, materials and physically based renders.

Features:
- Basic spheres and planes support
- Basic lambertian diffuse lighting
- Geometric transformations using translation, rotation and scaling matrices
- Moveable camera system
